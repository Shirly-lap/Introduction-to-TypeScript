## 1. Introduction to TypeScript 

- Exercise: Set up a new TypeScript project using `npm init` and install
  TypeScript globally using `npm install -g typescript`.
- Practice: Create a simple TypeScript file with variables of different data
  types and compile it to JavaScript using the `tsc` command(also you can use
  `npx ts-node FileName.ts` to execute the file).

## 2. TypeScript Basics

- Exercise: Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns
  their sum. Add type annotations for parameters and return type.
- Practice: Create an interface representing a car with properties like make,
  model, and year. Write a function that takes an object of type Car as a
  parameter and prints out its details.

## 3. Advanced TypeScript Features

- Exercise: Implement a generic function that takes an array of any type and
  returns the first element of the array.
- Practice: Define an enum for different days of the week. Write a function that
  takes a day of the week as a parameter and returns a string indicating whether
  it's a weekday or weekend.

## 4. Working with Modules 

- Exercise: Create two separate TypeScript files: one for exporting a function
  and another for importing and using that function.
- Practice: Explore different ways of exporting and importing modules, including
  default exports and named exports.

## 5. Handling Complex Data Functions

- Exercise: Write functions to perform common array operations like mapping,
  filtering, and reducing on an array of numbers.
- Practice: Create a class representing a shopping cart item with properties
  like name, price, and quantity. Implement methods to calculate the total price
  and add/remove items from the cart.

## 6. Advanced Data Handling

- Exercise: Parse a JSON string into a TypeScript object and vice versa.
  Practice: Use a third-party library like lodash to manipulate arrays and -
  objects in TypeScript. Write functions to sort an array of objects by a
  specific property.

## 7. Testing and Debugging TypeScript Code 

- Exercise: Write unit tests using Jest for the functions implemented in
  previous exercises.
- Practice: Debug TypeScript code in VS Code by setting breakpoints and
  inspecting variables.

## 8. Deploying TypeScript Applications 

- Exercise: Compile TypeScript code for production using the --prod flag and
  analyze the output.
- Practice: Deploy a simple TypeScript application to a cloud platform like
  Heroku or AWS Lambda.

## 9. Best Practices and Tips 

- Exercise: Refactor code written in earlier exercises to follow best practices
  like using descriptive variable names and avoiding any type of.
- Practice: Discuss common TypeScript coding patterns and anti-patterns, such as
  when to use interfaces vs. type aliases and how to handle nullable types.
